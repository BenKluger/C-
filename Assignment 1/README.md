This is the first assignment for my OOP C++ course. The task was to find a perfect square such that the last two digits are odd. If there is no such number, state so. The result was that there is no such perfect square such that the last two digits are odd. While I could not check every number up to infinity, I searched up to the largest integer value (which was then subsequently doubled), which was somewhere around 65,000 in this project. The reason I could not go higher was because the max value storage for an integer was reached. Using the keyword "long" would become necessary for the future.
